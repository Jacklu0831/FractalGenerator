# FractalGenerator (on-going project)
This projects aims to create a webpage that will allow for a dynamic viewing of the Mandelbrot, Julia, Multibrot, and Multi-Julia set with indepth explanation into how they are created. HTML5 is used for the page content, CSS is used for styling, and JavaScript (P5.js). The mathematical functions are recursive but the JS algorithm is implemented iteratively to avoid potential stack overflow. 

This project started in early March and is on-going due to its relatively large scope.

# Goals of the project
1. Create a dynamic Mandelbrot viewer
2. Extend the functionality to the filled Julia Sets (animated)
3. Create a viewer for the Multibrot set
4. Extend the same Julia Set functionality to the Multibrot set
5. Provide curious minds about how the algorithm works

# Progress

1. Mandelbrot set (left) and Julia set (right)

As shown in the gif, the animated Julia sets are generated in real-time based on the dynamic cursor coordinates.

2. Multibrot set with exponent of 3 (left) and Multi-Julia set(right)

3. User-input exponents (D-value) for the multibrot set with color mapping
